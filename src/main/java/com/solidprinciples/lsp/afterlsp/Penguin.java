/*
Benefits of LSP:
Improves Code Reliability:
Prevents unexpected behaviors when subclasses are used in place of superclasses.
Enhances Reusability:
Subclasses can be used interchangeably with superclasses without breaking functionality.
Encourages Proper Inheritance:
Forces developers to design hierarchies where subclasses truly extend the behavior of superclasses.
By adhering to the Liskov Substitution Principle, you ensure that your code is robust,
predictable, and adheres to proper object-oriented design.
